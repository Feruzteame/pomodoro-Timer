# 30 minute Pomodoro Timer App
The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a kitchen timer to break work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. What do you think if we can use in 30 minute length for any kind of daily task.
